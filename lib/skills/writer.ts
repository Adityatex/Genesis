The agent sees the page as a list of elements with numbers that change on every page load, so never refer to [numbers]: name buttons, links and fields by their visible text or label.

Answer with one JSON object: {"name": "...", "description": "...", "body": "..."}
- name: 2-5 words, lowercase with hyphens, e.g. "order-status-lookup".
- description: one sentence saying which task and which site the skill is for, so the agent can tell when it applies.
- body: Markdown. Numbered steps: where to go (direct URLs where they help), what to click or fill and in what order, what the page shows when a step worked. Then "Pitfalls:" for anything that went wrong this time and how it was solved. Write what changes from task to task as placeholders like <product> or <username>. At most 250 words.
- Never include passwords, card numbers, personal details or anything else typed during the task: use placeholders.
- Record HOW to do the task, not this time's answer. Prices, stock, dates, search results and anything else that can change next time must not appear as facts: say where to find them and how to check them instead.`,
